## Description
This project allows users to save time on their projects by generating a readme file purely in their terminal.

## Installation Instructions
Go to this project's Github repository, open the js code files, then open your bash or terminal. Make sure you are in the correct directory and you are set to launch by typing in node index.

## Usage Information
On the terminal, a user will be prompted with a series of efficient questions. Once all the questions have been answered, a READMe.md file will be generated which looks professional and contains all of the information that a good README file should contain.

## Contributions
